\section{Implementation}




%The output tensor is then passed through ReLU~\cite{relu} along with batch optimization. Subsequently, a max pooling layer is used followed by a  convolutional layer. The output is then once again processed by max pooling layer with configuration same as before.  The result is then flattened to a tensor which is passed to a fully connected layer and a ReLU. As the last layer a regressor is used to provide the measurements estimation.
