	ABSTRACT = {Joint estimation of the human body is suitable for many fields such as human–computer interaction, autonomous driving, video analysis and virtual reality. Although many depth-based researches have been classified and generalized in previous review or survey papers, the point cloud-based pose estimation of human body is still difficult due to the disorder and rotation invariance of the point cloud. In this review, we summarize the recent development on the point cloud-based pose estimation of the human body. The existing works are divided into three categories based on their working principles, including template-based method, feature-based method and machine learning-based method. Especially, the significant works are highlighted with a detailed introduction to analyze their characteristics and limitations. The widely used datasets in the field are summarized, and quantitative comparisons are provided for the representative methods. Moreover, this review helps further understand the pertinent applications in many frontier research directions. Finally, we conclude the challenges involved and problems to be solved in future researches.},

	abstract = {A 3D scanner is a non-contact, non-destructive digital device that uses a light line/laser to accurately capture the shape of a physical object into Computer-Aided Design (CAD) data. It generates a point cloud or a set of data points in a coordinate system that accurately depicts a physical object's size and shape. The urge of human beings to build and recreate 3D objects is an essential requirement in the context of Industry 4.0. In Industry 4.0, 3D scanners are helpful for designing, assessing the minor features of any product, capturing freeform, and providing precise point clouds for complicated geometry and curved surfaces. Today advanced technologies are being introduced in industries, and 3D scanning technology is one of the latest emerging technologies. The situation has progressed significantly, and the ever-emerging world of 3D technology still disrupts a variety of sectors. This paper discusses 3D Scanning, its working process, and its adoption for reverse engineering and Industry 4.0 culture. Finally, this paper covers essential features, traits, and applications of 3D Scanning for Industry 4.0. Using different methods, 3D Scanning can collect information about an item, about an object's highness, breadth, and depth. 3D scanners are available on the market from high-end possibilities. They have different resolutions, and now they provide details of the scan to superimpose colour on an object, but the industry wants them to be developed for other quality attributes.}
